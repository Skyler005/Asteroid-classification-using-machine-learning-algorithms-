Asteroid impacts have the potential to cause significant damage to our planet. Therefore, predicting
the possibility of an asteroid impact is of great importance. In recent years, machine learning has
emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing complex data sets, and asteroid impact prediction is no
exception. To predict the impact of an asteroid, we can extract various features like its minimum
and maximum diameter, estimated velocity, and absolute magnitude. These features can help
determine if an asteroid is hazardous or not. Several machine learning algorithms can be used for
asteroid impact prediction, including LGBM, GB, logistic regression, random forest, and decision
tree. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses. To evaluate the accuracy of these
algorithms, we can use confusion matrices, which allow us to analyze the true positive, true
negative, false positive, and false negative rates. By comparing the performance of these
algorithms using confusion matrices, we can determine which algorithm is best suited for asteroid
impact prediction.

Overall, machine learning has the potential to significantly improve our ability to predict asteroid
impacts and mitigate their potential damage.
